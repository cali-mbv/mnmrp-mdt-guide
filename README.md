# mnmrp-mdt-guide

### a small guide for the music n mayhem mdt by cali / roy railer
### a few things to note.
- this mdt loves right clicks if u cant figure something out you probably just need to right click something.
- incidents are to be used for arrests.
- reports are to be used for anything that doesn't directly involve an arrest, this is something high command will talk about later i assume. 
- make sure to save your incidents/reports after your done, this is done by clicking the big green button to the right of manage incident. 
- when you've given someone their charges make sure to modify the time n fine below the recommended to the actual ammount your giving to them. 
- make sure whenever u process someone that you click the "processed" button once u add said criminal. 


## how do i add charges? 
### simply add your criminal to your incident and right click as seen in the image, once u have all their charges simply press escape.

## how do i add images in the evidence tab?
### this one is also pretty simple. All you need to do is in your incident or report click on the + button at the evidence tab and add your image URL. This could be imgur, discord or whatever image hoster you use. Once you have pasted it in press enter. If you would like to expand the image right click and press expand.

## how do i attach myself to certain calls? 
### while on the dashboard tab of the mdt look in the bottom right of the calls section. Here you will see dispatch alerts simply right click on the call you would like to attach to and click attach. This is useful for making sure you dont go over units for certain calls. The numbers to the right of the call are the number of units that have attached themself.
